# mkosi vs Docker: Post-Implementation Analysis

After implementing both approaches and getting mkosi working end-to-end with DStack, here's the reality check against our initial hypotheses.

## What We Actually Built

### mkosi Implementation Reality
- **94MB compressed, 394MB uncompressed OS image** (vs ~180MB Docker image)
- **Manual npm dependency extraction** from vendored packages (npm not available in mkosi chroot)
- **Docker wrapper required** for root access (`docker run --privileged`)
- **DStack integration works** but required learning correct format (docker-compose.yml, not app-compose.json)
- **Complete deterministic build system** with registry integration

### Docker Implementation (Existing)
- **~180MB multi-layer OCI image** with BuildKit layer caching
- **Standard OCI registry workflow**
- **Complex Dockerfile** with manual cache cleanup and timestamp normalization
- **Mature tooling ecosystem** (layer diffs, registry push, etc.)

## Hypothesis vs Reality

### ✅ Confirmed Hypotheses
1. **"Single declarative config vs bespoke Dockerfile tricks"** - TRUE
   - mkosi.conf is cleaner than complex Dockerfile with manual cache cleanup
   - No need for manual `rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` etc.

2. **"Bit-for-bit reproducible with snapshot pinning"** - TRUE
   - Both approaches achieve deterministic builds
   - mkosi snapshot pinning works as expected

### ❌ Challenged Hypotheses
1. **"No hand-rolled cache scrubbing needed"** - PARTIALLY FALSE
   - Still needed manual npm dependency handling due to PATH issues
   - mkosi build environment doesn't have npm available by default

2. **"Easier when adding more debian packages"** - MIXED
   - ✅ Adding packages to mkosi.conf is cleaner than Dockerfile
   - ❌ But any complex setup still requires mkosi.build script

3. **"OCI conversion is simple"** - PARTIALLY FALSE
   - Docker import works but lost native OCI layering
   - DStack integration required learning new deployment patterns
   - Had to solve JSON escaping and docker-compose format issues

## When to Use Each Approach

### Use mkosi when:
- **Building OS images for VMs/containers** where you want full OS semantics
- **Simple package-based applications** where most deps come from distro packages
- **You prefer declarative configuration** over complex Dockerfiles
- **Target deployment supports OS images** (systemd-nspawn, VMs, etc.)

### Use Docker when:
- **Standard containerized applications** with existing OCI workflows
- **Complex multi-stage builds** with language-specific toolchains
- **Existing tooling expects OCI** (registries, scanners, layer analysis)
- **Layer-level optimization matters** (caching, minimal updates)

## Reliability Assessment

**Neither approach is inherently more reliable** - both achieve bit-for-bit reproducibility:
- Docker: Complex but well-understood manual cache management
- mkosi: Cleaner config but required workarounds for npm/Node.js ecosystem

## Complexity Trade-offs

### Docker Complexity
- Complex Dockerfile with manual cleanup
- BuildKit timestamp rewriting required
- Manual cache management knowledge needed

### mkosi Complexity
- Clean config + build script
- Docker wrapper for root requirements
- Learning mkosi-specific patterns
- Manual npm dependency handling
- New deployment format learning curve

## Final Recommendation

**For this specific project (simple Node.js app)**: Docker approach is more practical
- Existing tooling ecosystem
- Standard OCI workflow
- No additional conversion steps needed
- Familiar to most developers

**mkosi shines for**: OS-level applications where you're primarily installing distro packages, want VM/container hybrid deployment, and prefer declarative configuration over complex Dockerfiles.

The mkosi implementation was valuable for learning but doesn't provide compelling advantages for this particular use case.
